# Pilot Study: Applying Reinforcement Learning to Process Low-Quality Economic Data for Enhanced GDP Forecasting

## 1. Introduction

This pilot study aims to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of using reinforcement learning (RL) to process low-quality economic data for improving GDP forecasting models at both global and individual country levels. The study focuses on developing an RL-based data preprocessing agent that learns to handle and correct low-quality data by maximizing forecasting accuracy as its reward. Simulated environments will be used to expedite learning and testing, allowing for controlled experimentation and rapid iteration.

- **High-Quality Data Sources**:
  - Collect historical GDP and related economic indicators from reliable sources such as the World Bank or IMF for the selected countries.
- **Variables to Include**:
  - GDP, inflation rate, unemployment rate, interest rates, trade balances, etc.

#### 4.1.2. Simulating Low-Quality Data

- **Noise Injection**:
  - Add random noise to certain data points to simulate measurement errors.
- **Missing Data Simulation**:
  - Randomly remove data points or entire periods to mimic missing data scenarios.
- **Outlier Introduction**:
  - Insert anomalous values to represent data entry errors or outliers.

#### 4.1.3. Dataset Splitting

- **Training Set**: Historical data with simulated low quality.
- **Validation Set**: A portion of historical data kept intact for validation.
- **Test Set**: Recent data (e.g., the last 2 years) reserved for final performance evaluation.

### 4.2. Reinforcement Learning Framework

#### 4.2.1. RL Agent Design

- **Agent Objective**:
  - Learn data preprocessing actions that maximize the accuracy of GDP forecasts.
- **State Representation**:
  - The current state of the data point or dataset segment (e.g., presence of missing values, statistical properties).
- **Action Space**:
  - Possible data preprocessing actions:
    - Impute missing values (mean, median, interpolation).
    - Correct outliers (capping, removal).
    - Apply smoothing or filtering techniques.
    - Leave data unchanged.
- **Reward Function**:
  - Based on the improvement in forecasting accuracy after preprocessing:
    - Positive reward for actions leading to lower prediction error.
    - Penalty for actions that degrade performance.

#### 4.2.2. RL Algorithm Selection

- **Algorithm Choice**:
  - Use a policy gradient method like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) or Deep Q-Networks (DQN) due to their effectiveness in handling continuous action spaces and stability in training.
- **Neural Network Architecture**:
  - **Input Layer**: Accepts state representation.
  - **Hidden Layers**: Fully connected layers with ReLU activation functions.
  - **Output Layer**: Outputs probabilities for each action (for policy-based methods) or action-value estimates (for value-based methods).

#### 4.2.3. Environment Simulation

- **Simulated Environment**:
  - Encapsulates the data processing pipeline.
  - Provides the RL agent with states and receives actions.
  - Updates the dataset based on actions and computes rewards.

### 4.3. GDP Forecasting Model

#### 4.3.1. Baseline Model

- **Traditional Model**:
  - Use a standard time series forecasting model (e.g., ARIMA or VAR) trained on preprocessed data.

#### 4.3.2. Enhanced Model

- **AI-Based Model**:
  - Implement a machine learning model (e.g., LSTM neural network) for GDP forecasting.

#### 4.3.3. Integration with RL Agent

- **Feedback Loop**:
  - The RL agent preprocesses the data, which is then fed into the forecasting model.
  - The forecasting model's performance provides the reward signal to the RL agent.
